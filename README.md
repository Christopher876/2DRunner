# 2DRunner
A simple 2D runner game project I was working on to get a little bit more aquainted with the Unity design practices and more C# programming. I would say that it has served its purpose and it has taught me ebnough for me to work on a bigger project.
So since it has no more use for me per say. I am deciding to make it open source for anyone to come look at and possibly learn from. There will be commits on this repository here and there but not some big project changes!
